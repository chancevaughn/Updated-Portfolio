## The Coding Magic

Just like all modern webpages, this portfolio was built with mobile-first in mind.  The layout, pictures, and tabs dynamically respond to whether you are on mobile or desktop for the most optimal viewing experience.

In addition, each peice of work has a corresponding deployed link and gitHub link that appears when clicked.

Lastly, the correspoding links for the contact section are live. Meaning that when you click on them they will begin an action for the desired form of communication (i.e a phone call for the phone icon).
